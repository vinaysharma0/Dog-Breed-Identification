# Dog-Breed-Identification

Dataset for this model is not here but i am providing the link below

                            https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification
                            
I used 3 ways to classify a dog breed : 
      (1.) my own CNN : ACCURACY = 57%
      (2.) ResNet50 (pre-trained model) : ACCURACY = 75%
      (3.) InceptionV3 (pre-trained model) : ACCURACY = 92%
      (4.) NASNetLarge (pre-trained model) : ACCURACY = 95%
      
      
As we can see which one is the best among these 4 models.

Its great that we got 95% accuracy with NASNetLarge which is trained on IMAGENET dataset which is likely to be known as one of the biggest image classification dataset with around 14 million images which is a Huge number.
